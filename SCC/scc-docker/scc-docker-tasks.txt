SCC Docker tasks.

1. Created docker-compose file for all containers.
2. Modified Dockerfile for scc ui(react) application. Removed nginx and custom build folder.
3. created build_scc.sh file for building image.
4. created deploy_scc.sh file for deploying from compressed files. Facing some issues here. (the env file is not in compressed image).

Issues:
1. git clone url needs private key to be added in ~/.ssh/ directory.
2. need to pass password while cloning after execution of the build script.
3. Need to find a way to name docker hub images with custom name. (Mostly can be created Dockerfile for same).
4. Created compressed version of images. However when trying to deploy it from images the environment file is not available.
   Should we copy iit explicitly? or is there any option in docker image save.
   This will be required/helpful for other containers as well.
5. There are some warnings about unused code and deprecated library version.

TODO:
1. dockerize spring boot app is in progerss. (Should be simple, but reading on using spring profiles).
2. npm version in scc-ui is throwing warnings about version. Also unncessary packages should be removed.
3. Explore ways to create prod (environment vars) build of SCC UI app.
